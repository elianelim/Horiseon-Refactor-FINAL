# Horiseon Webpage

## Description
This project is working on refactoring the codes on the Webpage for Horiseon. The codes for HTML and CSS was provided although the webpage looks good, there are many enhancement to be made so it can be accessible for every users. 

Being a new-web developer, I would like to increase my skills in HTML and CSS as they are brand new language to me. And trying to figure out which heading or elements are suitable for the webpage was very tricky for me as they all have similar outlook. However, with lots of help and guidance from my fellow peers and educators, I managed to recreate the webpage to somewhat user and developer friendly. And if some other developers were to continue buidling on the webpage, they can easily identify the codes to be modified. The codes did not change the outlook of the page but it enhanced the display of the codes on the HTML and CSS. 

* Renamed the title to a more descriptive name 
* Renamed some of the elements to semantic HTML (header,main, nav, section, article, aside)
* CSS rearranged and tagged to the class with a name (e.g service, benefit)
* Added comments into HTML documment and CSS file 
* Consolidated some of the CSS codes into one selector so as the codes are not repeated 
* Label every heading/element to make myself understand better as this is my FIRST project!
* Added "alt" tag to every images just in case there was an error to load the picture, there are still descriptive text about the image, besides that it is also accessible for all kind of users.
* Linked the "Search Engine Optimization" to an ID so that it links to the paragraph

With this project, I have learned to always keep trying and never give up and making mistakes is a NEW way of learning. I have also learned to keep asking questions even though I think that it is a silly one. I also learned that most of the mistakes I make which working on the project is either a typo error or simply one extra word in my heading MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE in my work!
